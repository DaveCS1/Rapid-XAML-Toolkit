# Getting Started




## Working with source

Open `RapidXamlToolkit.sln` in the 'RapidXAML.VSIX' folder.
The solution contains two projects:
- `RapidXamlToolkit`is the code for the extension. Run/debug this project and an experimental instance of VS will be launched that has the extension already installed.
- `RapidXamlToolkit.Tests` is a test project containing the automated tests.

## Installing the beta extension

Please see the [installation guide](https://github.com/mrlacey/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/blob/dev/docs/installation.md#nightly-dev-builds).

## Installing the release extension

Coming soon.
