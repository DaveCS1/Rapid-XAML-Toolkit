# Profiles

A profile is a set of rules and settings that apply to the way the tool works.

## Mappings

Mappings are the encapsulation of the logic for turning the properties in C# or VB code into XAML.
Each profile will contain multiple mappings.
Each mapping is the specific rule for the generation of XAML for a specific property. A profile includes a configurable list of mappings for different combinations of type, name, and accessibility.

A mapping can match multiple property types. To specify multiple types, separate them with the pipe (|) character.

A mapping can be made to only apply to properties that are read-only. This is useful if you want different output for properties that can be edited.

A mapping can be made to apply to properties based on the property name. If name filters are provided, mapping will only be used if the name of the property contains the value specified. To specify multiple types, separate them with the pipe (|) character. Note that this check is case insensitive.

Mappings are matched in the following order:

1. Property Type.
2. If the property is Read-Only.
3. Property Name.

If a property matches multiple mappings, there is no guarantee on which will be used.

### Special mappings

In addition to the mappings for properties, there are also three special mappings that must be configured.

- Fallback
- Sub-Property
- Enum Members

#### Fallback mapping

The mapping used when a property does not match any other mapping.

#### Sub-Property mapping

The mapping used for properties included from the **$subprops$** placeholder.
Only **$name$**, **$incint$**, and **$repint$** placeholders are valid in the sub-property output.

#### Enum Members mapping

The mapping used for properties included from the **$members$** placeholder.
Only the **$element$**, **$elementwithspace$** and **$enumname$** placeholders are valid in the enum member output.

## Placeholders

Profile settings and mappings can include placeholders. A placeholder is something that will be replaced in the generated code. The following placeholders are defined.

### File Generation placeholders

- **$viewproject$** The name of the project that the view will be created in.
- **$viewns$** The namespace the view will be created in. This is based on project and file structure.
- **$viewmodelns$** The namespace the view model will be created in. This is based on project and file structure.
- **$viewclass$** The name of the view class that will be created.
- **$viewmodelclass$** The name of the view model class that will be created.
- **$genxaml$** Where the generated XAML will be included in the created file.

### XAML generation placeholders

- **$name$** Property name.
- **$namewithspaces$** Property name with spaces inserted between words if the name is camelCase or PascalCase.
- **$type$** Property type.
- **$incint$** Incrementing integer. A number (starting at zero) that will increase with each property that is matched in a class.
- **$repint$** Repeating integer. The same number that was last used, repeated without increment. Useful when you want output with multiple items in the same row.
- **$subprops$** Sub-properties. Is replaced with output from the sub-property mapping for each property of the matched type. Useful when outputting collections of items.
- **$members$** Enum members. Is replaced with output from the enum member mapping for each property of the matched type.
- **$element$** Enum element. Is replaced with the name of an individual enum element.
- **$elementwithspaces$** Enum element. Is replaced with the name of an individual enum element and spaces are inserted between words if the name is camelCase or PascalCase.
- **$enumname$** Enum property name. Is replaced with the name of the enum property.
- **$nooutput$** No Output. Nothing will be included in the generated XAML when this is in the mapping output.
- **$xname$** A generated value based on the property name and the XAML element this is used within.
- **$repxname$** Repeat the last generated $xname$ value. If no $xname$ value has been generated, the attribute this is used within will be omitted from the output.
