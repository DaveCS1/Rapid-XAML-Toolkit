# RXT160

`SelectedItem` binding should probably be `TwoWay`.

## Description

To receive notification of selection changes, set `BindingMode` to `TwoWay`.

## Why this is suggested


Not specifying the most appropriate `InputScope` can make it harder for users to enter the desired information. This is particularly true if they are not using a device with a physical keyboard.
Even if you want the "Default" value for this property, you are suggested to specify this to make it clear to others who look at the code that this you have considered what is the most appropriate option for the data being captured.

## How to address the issue

Press `Crtl + .` and use the suggested action 'Specify InputScope property.'
