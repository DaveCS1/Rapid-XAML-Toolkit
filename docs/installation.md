# Installation

There are multiple installation options available if you don't want to build from source.
We do not recommend having more than one version of the extension installed in a version of Visual Studio.

## Preview Release

You can now [get an early preview release from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlPreview).

Please note that the [preview release](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlPreview) will be removed once the official release is available.

## Official Releases

Details will be added here once available.

## Nightly (dev) builds

A new nightly build will be available shortly. The one that Micorsoft previously made available via MyGet is no longer updated and will eventually be deleted.

***

Once installed you can begin using the extension and should [start by configuring it for the way you work](./configuration.md).
