# Installation

There are multiple installation options available if you don't want to build from source.
We do not recommend having more than one version of the extension installed in a version of Visual Studio.

## Preview Release

You can now [get an early preview release from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlPreview).

Please note that the [preview release](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.RapidXamlPreview) will be removed once the official release is available.

## Official Releases

Details will be added here once available.

## Canary builds

Automated builds with the [latest version](http://vsixgallery.com/extension/RapidXamlToolkit.0dc8e86a-836b-47e5-aa3f-f5e71c15e37a/) of all functionality are available from the [VSIX Gallery](http://vsixgallery.com/guide/feed/). These are produced every time PRs are merged that contain code changes.

_A version distributed via MyGet is no longer available._

***

Once installed you can begin using the extension and should [start by configuring it for the way you work](./configuration.md).
